# Client Manual
- [Installing FiveM](/docs/client-manual/installing-fivem)
- [Console commands](/docs/client-manual/console-commands)

## FiveM singleplayer
FiveM also ships with a customized singleplayer mode. This brings the FiveM experience to singleplayer. For this to
work, you currently need to have a valid savegame from the original game. Save your game at least once before starting
FiveM SP, and copy it into the FiveM profile directory in Documents\Rockstar Games\GTA V (the one with a fivem_set.bin).

## Using plugins
FiveM allows the use of certain plugins. You can install these by going to your plugins folder within FiveM's
application data folder. If you have no such folder yet, you can create it. Within this folder you can place
many types of .asi scripts you would typically use in singleplayer.


  :::caution Beware

- Servers have the option to disallow the use of plugins. Therefore, you might not be able to use your plugins at all
  servers you play on.
- Use at your own risk. Some plugins are outdated and/or not compatible with FiveM and may crash your game.
  FiveM is not responsible for any such event and will not provide support for the use of plugins.

Server Browser

The server browser allows for some neat searching tricks:

- Type `~foo ~bar` to exclude servers running foo or bar
